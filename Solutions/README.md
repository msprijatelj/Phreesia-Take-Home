Final submission is `problem.py`.  Install Python modules from `requirements.txt` before running.  To run the script, use the following command in the command line:

```bash
python3 problem.py ${visitCsv} ${screenCsv} ${screenThresh}
```

Where `visitCsv` is the CSV filename of visiting volume, `screenCsv` is the CSV filename of the screening volume, and `screenThresh` is the integer threshold of screenings on a given day.

Requested answers are given in `Answers_to_Questsions.docx`.

The iPython notebook `problem_nb.ipynb` is the scratchpad I used to hash out my solution & interact with the provided data; `problem.py` is my actual submission.
